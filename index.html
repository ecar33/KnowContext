                <ul>
                    <li>Clear hierarchical governance (boards, presidents, provosts, deans) establishes accountability.
                    </li>
                    <li>Standardized academic units (schools, departments, programs) support scale and consistency.</li>
                    <li>Accreditation systems provide quality assurance and legitimacy.</li>
                    <li>Dedicated offices for admissions, advising, aid, and student services support the full student

                    <li>Legacy and overlapping IT systems result in inconsistent interfaces and workflows.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="swot-cell">
                <h2>Opportunities (External)</h2>
