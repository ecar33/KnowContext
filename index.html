        <h2>Strengths (Internal)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Clear hierarchical governance (boards, presidents, provosts, deans) establishes accountability.</li>
          <li>Standardized academic units (schools, departments, programs) support scale and consistency.</li>
          <li>Accreditation systems provide quality assurance and legitimacy.</li>
          <li>Dedicated offices for admissions, advising, aid, and student services support the full student lifecycle.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Highly siloed academic and administrative units create fragmented user experiences.</li>
          <li>Shared governance and committee processes slow decision-making and change.</li>
          <li>Complex policies and procedures increase cognitive load for students and faculty.</li>
          <li>Legacy and overlapping IT systems result in inconsistent interfaces and workflows.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

          <li>Growth of online, hybrid, and flexible programs enables new structural models.</li>
          <li>Improved data collection and analytics can increase transparency and accountability.</li>
          <li>Industry and community partnerships create clearer pathways from education to employment.</li>

        <h2>Threats (External)</h2>
